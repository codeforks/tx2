## tx2

tx2 is a fork of Terminator, a console terminal for GTK.

# Main goals

- Introduce Rust, and achieve some crazy safety!

- Modernized UI
  - Goodbye to that useless top bar!

- Better scriptability
  - (ie. reload preferences on the fly)

- The skys the limit

# Why a fork ?

- Philosophy differences
- Features are needed, experimentation is required.
- Preference for Git over Bazaar version control.
